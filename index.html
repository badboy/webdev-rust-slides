I'm here to talk a bit about Web Development with Rust.

Or as others have stated it:

Hire me for the JS, keep me for the Rust

studying computer science in Aachen, not too far
lots of open source stuff, maintaining libraries for Redis.

if you use Hiredis: I'm sorry for breaking your build once in a while ;)

ots teacher / conf organizer

Rust in August 2014, frustrated with C++

stuck with it, released a dozen small crates

---

<iframe src="http://time.hellorust.com/legacy">

???

as it turns out I'm bad at keeping track of time.

That's why I built an awesome time tracker.

maybe it is just a bare time tracker, 
but cope with me, because it will be enough to show what I want to talk about:

# [Are we web yet?](http://arewewebyet.org/)*

.footnote2[\* [arewewebyet.org](http://arewewebyet.org/)]

???

And that is if we are web yet.

Rust is a systems programming language by heart.

also just fine for webdevelopment or on a good way 

The things I will be talking about today are btw listed on that site

Who is a webdev?  
Who uses Ruby?  
Who uses Node.js?  
Who already uses Rust?  
Rust for webdev?

# Software Stack

- Backend
- &nbsp;&nbsp; Data store &amp; Access
- &nbsp;&nbsp; Logic / API
- Frontend
- &nbsp;&nbsp; HTML, CSS 
- &nbsp;&nbsp; JavaScript

???

Usual stack for an app  
later quick tour through crates that give us this

Backend with datalayer, the database  
Actual logic through a framework

backend talks to your frontend

UI in HTML & CSS, so a browser can display it  
some JavaScript to make it more interactive

---
class: center, middle, nearly-huge

# Backend

???

timetracker quite simple: 

Redis for data storage

Cuba, like Sinatra, for backend providing an API

first: web frameworks

---
class: bullets, bigger

# Webframeworks

- Iron
- Nickel
- Rustful
- Rustless
- Pencil
- …

???

Quite a few

Two major ones: Iron and Nickel

---
class: command

# Iron

```bash
fn hello(_: &mut Request) -> IronResult<Response> {
    Ok(Response::with((status::Ok, "Hello World!")))
}

Iron::new(hello).http("localhost:3000").unwrap();
```

.footnote2[[ironframework.io](http://ironframework.io/)]

???

focus on providing middleware interface

not batteries-included

basic stuff available as middleware by Iron or others

---
class: command

# Nickel.rs

```bash
let mut server = Nickel::new();

server.utilize(router! {
    get "**" => |_req, _res| {
        "Hello world!"
    }
});

server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");
```

.footnote2[[nickel.rs](http://nickel.rs/)]

???

More bundled stuff

still middleware possible

relies on Macros, but usable without

inspired by express.js, a node.js framework

---
class: bullets, bigger

# Hyper (HTTP library)

- client &amp; server
- low-level
- type-safe

.footnote2[[hyper.rs](http://hyper.rs/)]

???

One thing in common: Hyper

Major HTTP library for Rust

provides Server & Client

very low-level, type-safe

---
class: bullets, bigger

# Hyper (soon)

- Asynchronous IO
- HTTP2 (hopefully)

.footnote2[[hyper.rs](http://hyper.rs/)]

???

some issues

not Asynchronous yet: more threads  
it's being worked on, already competitive with existing web servers
plus side: all will profit

no HTTP2 in server yet  
will follow

---
class: bullets, bigger

# Database access

- [MySQL](https://crates.io/crates/mysql)
- [Postgres](https://crates.io/crates/postgres)
- [SQLite](https://crates.io/crates/rusqlite)
- [Redis](https://crates.io/crates/redis)
- […](http://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/database/)

.footnote[Everything above is a link ;)]

???

Database side looks good

Clients for major databases  
Mostly taking advantage of type system (safe interfaces)

Generalized connection pool interface (useful for real usage)

---
class: bigger, command

# Diesel

### Rust:

```bash
Post::belonging_to(user).load(&connection)
```

### Executed SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = 1;
```

.footnote2[[diesel.rs](http://diesel.rs/)]

???

Coming to ORM even better off: Diesel

Safe, extensible Query Builder  
Full advantage of Type System

Think ActiveRecord (Rails) without major issues

It's even faster than hand-written

---
class: center, middle, bigger

<iframe src="http://time.hellorust.com/app">

???

Listed things enough to build a basic backend

I used Iron and Redis for Awesome Time Tracker

and it works

---
class: center, middle, bigger

# Ruby

???

So, first we got Ruby …

---
class: center, middle, bigger, striked

# Ruby
## Rust

???

… and now replaced it with Rust

---
class: center, middle, nearly-huge

# Frontend

???

Now let's take a look at the frontend

Time Tracker is a basic single-page app.

Not even a big framework in use

---

# How do we run Rust in the Frontend?

???

You might wonder: Browser only knows HTML and CSS and JavaScript

How do we even run Rust in the frontend?

Partially right. It only understands those.

But we don't have to write those.

---

![Emscripten](media/emscripten-logo.png)

.footnote2[[emscripten.org](http://emscripten.org)]

???

There is a tool called Emscripten

It takes whatever comes out of LLVM, a compiler backend for C and other languages 

and turns that into unreadable JavaScript  
(even more unreadable than hand-written)

Rust uses LLVM
possible to write Rust, turn that into JavaScript and have it run in the browser

works in older rust with hacks  
will work soon without hacks  
some patches in llvm and emscripten needed


---

# Turning Rust into JavaScript:

# [rust-webplatform](https://github.com/tcr/rust-webplatform)

.footnote2[by tcr, tomaka and AerialX]

???

only problem is the interface with all the stuff available in the frontend

Some nice folks already did hard work and wrote rust-webplatform  
bindings that translate between the JavaScript part and the Rust part through some of the functions Emscripten offers.


---
class: command

# DOM Handling

```bash
let document = webplatform::init();

let track = document.element_query("#track");
track.on("click", |_e| {
    toggle_timer(&document);
});
load_dom(&document);
```

???

Somewhat easy to use

Access to the DOM with Rusty and type-safe interface

---
class: command

# Glue code

```bash
fn ajax<F: FnMut(String) + 'a>(&self,
                               url: &str, f: F) {
  unsafe {
  let b = Box::new(f);
   let a = &*b as *const _;
   js!{(url, a as *const libc::c_void,
        caller::<F> as *const libc::c_void)
       br#"
       jQuery.ajax({url: UTF8ToString($0)})
         .done(function(data) {
         Runtime.dynCall('vii', $2, [$1,
           allocate(intArrayFromString(data),
                    'i8', ALLOC_STACK)]);
       …
```

???

'

To shock you a bit

Glue code necessary to give you access to jquery

<iframe src="http://time.hellorust.com/app">

???

I went ahead and rewrote my frontend in Rust.

It still works

---
class: center, middle, bigger

# JavaScript

???

I know I took some liberties here   
to force the usage of Rust on the frontend.  


---
class: center, middle, bigger, striked

# JavaScript
## Rust

???

But hey, I did it. No more _pure_ JavaScript hand-written by me.

Instead some nice Rust code

We removed Ruby in the backend and replaced it with Rust.  

We removed JavaScript in the frontend and replaced it with Rust.

class: center, middle, nearly-huge

# Browser

???

Still something left that's not Rust

The browser

Millions of C++ code  
The same bugs over and over again

Mostly single-threaded

---

# Servo

![Servo Screenshot](media/screenshot.png)

.footnote2[[servo.org](https://servo.org/)]

???

Servo, a browser engine developed at Mozilla.

prototype of browser engine with parallel architecture  
from the ground up

Thanks to Rust get rid of whole bug classes

---
class: center, middle, bigger

![Servo](media/servo-desktop.png)

???

Servo runs our awesome timetracker just fine,  
because afterall it's just some simple HTML   
and this huge blob of JavaScript that we got from our Rust frontend code.

Servo is nearwhere being a real replacement for Chrome or Firefox,
but it's a promising experiment where Rust shines.

And it got a whole lot faster lately by using the GPU for most of the layouting

???

One more  thing Servo can do:  
It can run on mobile phones as well.

Take browser engine, compile it for Android or FirefoxOS and run it

# C++

???

So at last, we replaced our large C++ based browser …

---
class: center, middle, bigger, striked

# C++
## Rust

???

… with some not that large Rust project

which finalizes our Web stack

---

# Recap

- Backend
- &nbsp;&nbsp; Frameworks (Iron, Nickel, ...)
- &nbsp;&nbsp; Databases adapters (SQL, Redis, ...)
- Frontend
<!--- &nbsp;&nbsp; Template languages-->
- &nbsp;&nbsp; Emscripten

???

Let's recap what I showed you

Libraries for the backend

Even some stuff for the frontend

didn't even mention template libraries yet, but they are out there

not everything is there yet

# Is all of this a good idea?
## ABSOLUTELY

???

You might ask:

Is it a good idea to use Rust everywhere

To which I have to answer: ABSOLUTELY

---
class: center, middle

# Ok, probably it's not

???

Ok, maybe it's really not the best idea to use it everywhere,  
especially if we have good long-standing libraries in other languages  
or if we have to compile to a completely different language

---
class: center, middle, bigger

# Or maybe it is:<br>[webassembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/README.md)\* is coming

.footnote2[\*"a binary format for the web"]

???

but maybe it still is.

because WebAssembly is definitely coming

it will be a binary format for the web  
major browser implementors are working on it  
servo has ideas how to integrate it  

would allow more efficient code in the browser, e.g. games
that's the idea …

---
class: center, middle, bigger

![WASM](media/tweet.png)

???

but really it's just about writing more Lisp again

So back to our initial question: ???  
Yes, You can build stuff!

The basics are there, promising way.

We need more work on documentation and tutorials.

People trying this stuff.  
People developing this stuff.

Take a look around.
